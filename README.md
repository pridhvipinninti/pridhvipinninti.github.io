## Projects
### WWDatabase System (Advanced Battery MaterialsLab)

- Engineered a full-stack data management platform for research labs using PostgreSQL, Retool, and DBT to replace spreadsheet-based workflows.
- Integrated dynamic SQL queries with JavaScript-based event logic to enable responsive form inputs, live validation, and modular record updates.
- Created dashboards for real-time tracking of experiments, synthesis, and testing data, enhancing traceability and data integrity.
- Enabled file uploads and visual data interactions using Retool Storage and dynamic interfaces for scalable research operations.



### Question Answering LLM on Endometrosis

- This project aims to develop a question-answering system focused on endometriosis based on real-time Interviews from experts and specialists.
- The system is built using Fast API for the web framework and employs the “Sentence Transformer” model to provide relevant answers to user queries.
- The data used in this project consists of transcript documents extracted from the personal interviews.
- Each document is cleaned manually organised into a question and a corresponding context or answer, forming the basis for the question-answering model.
